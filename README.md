# Advent of code 2024 - my solutions
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an initiative by Eric Wastl to provide a series of programming puzzles for the month of December. This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles, written in Go.

Every time, solutions are structured in the following way: Each day has its own folder, containing the input data and the solution code. Each part is made in a separate file called `partX.go` where `X` is the part number (1 or 2). The input data of each problem is stored in a file called `input.txt`.

Of course my solutions might not be the best, but as I'm doing this on my (very little) free time in university, I'm not really looking for the best solution, but for the one that works. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request! :)

I'm currently not doing part two of the problems yet due to the lack of free time. I might go back to the problems and solve part two too!
